## Overview

My time working at Sony Interactive Entertainment (referred to as PlayStation throughout) has been nothing short of phenomenal. I am so proud to have contributed to such an incredible team full of talented, caring, and helpful people. My team's name is **Game Validation & Integration Platform (GVIP)**, responsible for integrating and testing developmental features of the PlayStation for PC (PSPC) SDK within our propietary flagship game.

## My Work

My work as a Software Engineer primarily focuses on:
- Feature Integration
- Upgrading Unreal Engine version
- Debugging Faulty Features
- Code Maintainance

### Feature Integration

I was responsible for integrating a new PSPC feature API into our game's frontend and backend to display retrieved information in the UI. The first challenge of this involved creating new **C++** utility classes and functions for the purpose of compatibility with Unreal Engine's reflection system and therefore accessible in Blueprints and UI widgets.
